# LastFM Dataset Analysis with PySpark

In this project, I have worked with the PySpark module in Python, utilizing the Google Colab environment to apply queries to a dataset related to the Last.fm website. Last.fm is an online music service where users can listen to different songs. 

The dataset consists of two CSV files, namely "listening.csv" (1GB containing 13,758,905 rows) and "genre.csv" (3 MB containing 138,415 rows).

## Analysis with PySpark and Matplotlib

Using PySpark, I have performed queries and transformations on the dataset to gain insights and extract meaningful information. PySpark's distributed computing capabilities have allowed me to efficiently process the data, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. By utilizing the Google Colab environment, I have executed the PySpark code and conducted the queries.

Alongside data analysis, I have also visualized the query results using the Matplotlib library.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in working with PySpark, performing data analysis, leveraging distributed computing, and visualizing query results using Matplotlib. This project has allowed me to showcase my skills in data analysis, distributed computing with PySpark, and data visualization, while exploring a real-world dataset within the context of Last.fm.
